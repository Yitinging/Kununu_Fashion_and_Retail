We are driven by designing and implementing user-centric systems, that consider the unique challenges and implications of human computer interactions while driving. A promising path to understanding user’s needs is through analyzing and understanding the environment they are exposed to while driving. Exploring this dynamic context provides valuable insights for tailoring interactions that enhance user experience and safety on the road. This Master’s Thesis aims at using state of the art machine learning methodologies to encode, and understand such context variables and enable novel applications. By delving into advanced techniques, we seek to create intelligent systems that seamlessly integrate with the driving environment, ultimately improving the overall usability and effectiveness of incar interactions.
