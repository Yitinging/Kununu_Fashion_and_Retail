Project Overview

This repository contains various analyses and web scraping projects focused on competitive analysis, employee attrition, and job posting data. The data has been sourced from multiple companies like Hugo Boss, LVMH, Adidas, Porsche, and Ralph Lauren. The repository is organized into different folders, each representing a specific analysis or data processing task.

Folder and File Descriptions

1. Code for First Presentation
Contains the initial code used for preparing the first presentation of the project.
Used for demonstrating initial insights and analysis using basic data processing techniques.

2. NLP with Kununu Data
Implements Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze employee reviews from Kununu.
Key tasks include text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and extracting key topics from employee feedback.

3. Web Scrape Data from Job Postings
Scripts and data files related to web scraping job postings from various company websites.
Data extracted includes job titles, locations, functions, and additional insights (e.g., company descriptions).

4. Posting Frequency Analysis
Analyzes the frequency and distribution of job postings over time.
Used to identify hiring trends, peak posting times, and department-level demands.

5. Regression Analysis
Contains regression models applied to various datasets to understand the relationships between job postings, employee movement, and company performance.
Focused on predicting attrition and identifying key variables impacting employee retention.

6. Hugo_Boss_Attrition.csv
